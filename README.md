# Standard_lib

### A standard library for my python projects

## Description

This is a standard library for my python projects. It contains a collection of utility functions and classes that I use frequently in my projects. 
The goal of this library is to provide a consistent and reusable set of tools that can be used across different projects.

__Be aware that there is a reverse shell as part of the library__

I use that reverse shell to quickly do basic tasks over the internet e.g. filename editting.

I do not condone the use of reverse shells for any malicious activity.

Also, the functions are pretty shit and not detailed :P
